# README #

This is a work in progress for my employer Wilson Mei.

### What is this repository for? ###

*This repository is for my instructor to view and inspect my code progress.

The files you see now is the root, the first three folders are the main apps of the project. 
Landing_page, secondary_page and shopping_page. Each of these apps have their own respective purpose.
wilsite folder is the project folder that contains the settings.py and the main urls.py.

In the landing_page app, its purpose is to provide the user landing onto the page with the fading logo, 
followed by the work gallery presented as the second parallax. When the images are clicked in the gallery 
a modal will pop up fading out the background and expanding the current image bigger and providing a 
description of the photo, sample photos were included. Lastly the newsletter feature is the last parallax 
of the page, it takes in both String values for Name and Email, if an empty input is submitted a validation 
error will be invoked.

Another page was added in the landing_page app. Its template is called about-wilson, this template/page is solely 
about Mr. Mei's input on the company.

In secondary_page, it was added after the second meeting with Mr. Mei. Its purpose is to provide customers with 
808Prints services, followed by a contact us form. This form takes in Email, Subject and Message inputs, all String 
values. When submitted, the mail will be send to my email by default for testing purposes.

Lastly the shopping_page app is still work in progress and needs to be sent.
