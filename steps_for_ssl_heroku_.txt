tl:dr;
We would like to secure our site (via HTTPS)! SSL is the way to do so, however it can be a tricky process. Thanks to a lot of leg work by @eco-simon , we have simplified the steps below.

Steps
First you need to upgrade your dyno to at least Hobby ($7/mo) to allow for SSL ACM
Then you are going to want to enable certificates by running this command:
$ heroku certs:auto:enable
Make sure your DNS manager (Godaddy) has a record set up like so:
CNAME
www
travelwithyonder.com.herokudns.com
Then you are going to want to redirect your HTTP to HTTPS. Let's add this line in settings:
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
or even better:

# if statement to overcome .env boolean treatment
if config('SSL_ON') == 'False':
	SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False
else:
	SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
